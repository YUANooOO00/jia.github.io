I’m Jia Sun, a PhD student at [HKUST(GZ)] (https://www.hkust-gz.edu.cn/) , supervised by [Pan Hui]（https://panhui.people.ust.hk/） and [James She] (https://smedia.hkust.edu.hk/james/). Previously, I earned an MPhil at HKUST(GZ) with Pan Hui and [David Yip] (https://facultyprofiles.hkust-gz.edu.cn/faculty-personal-page?id=1). I hold a Bachelor’s in Innovation Design from the [China Academy of Art] (https://en.caa.edu.cn/).

As a practice-based artist and researcher, I focus on human-computer interaction, extended reality (XR), and AI-driven immersive learning. My work integrates critical theory with creative practice, designing digital experiences for art, education, and cultural heritage. My research centers on digital human modeling, interactive installations, and the development of immersive environments.

My research has been published at top international conferences including SIGGRAPH, SIGGRAPH Asia and IEEE VR, and my artworks have been exhibited at major venues such as the China Art Museum (Shanghai), Zhangjiang Science Hall (Shanghai), Zhejiang Exhibition Hall, Hangzhou International Expo Center, and Citylight Art Museum (Shenzhen). Looking ahead, I am committed to further exploring the integration of technology and art to empower digital humanities and future education.
