I am Jia Sun, holding a Bachelorâ€™s degree from the School of Innovation Design, China Academy of Art, and currently pursuing my MPhil at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou), under the supervision of [Prof. Pan Hui](https://panhui.people.ust.hk/). As a practice-based artist and researcher, I focus on human-computer interaction, extended reality (XR), and AI-driven immersive learning. My work integrates critical theory with creative practice, designing digital experiences for art, education, and cultural heritage. My research centers on digital human modeling, interactive installations, and the development of immersive environments, and I am proficient in digital creation tools such as Unity, Blender, and Unreal Engine.

I believe that the future of creative work and experience will emerge from the co-evolution of mind, body, and intelligent systems. The convergence of art, technology, and the humanities will continuously expand the boundaries of creativity, experiential learning, and collective memory. My research has been published at top international conferences including SIGGRAPH, SIGGRAPH Asia, IEEE VR, and VINCI, and my artworks have been exhibited at major venues such as the China Art Museum (Shanghai), Zhangjiang Science Hall (Shanghai), Zhejiang Exhibition Hall, Hangzhou International Expo Center, and Citylight Art Museum (Shenzhen). Looking ahead, I am committed to further exploring the integration of technology and art to empower digital humanities and future education.
